## Introduction
The workflow aims to establish a user-level datamart that is highly flexible for seamless integration with CRM data.

The entire segmentation stage can be orchestrated efficiently using Google Colab.

Easily create a single holistic view of all customers by joining GA4 data with CRM data.
Flexible for various (generic or custom)  segmentation use cases and experimentation with modeling (clustering methods, rule-based segmentation, ml based segments, dashboarding, automated activation etc.).
Can be easily integrated with Customer Match using Ads Api or Google Ads Data Manager.
